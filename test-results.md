# Test Results - Assessment Results Issue Investigation

**Date:** September 24, 2025
**Assessment ID:** cmfysmls00001u3p8d80ydd0h
**Job ID:** cmfysn2u70003u3p8eed6jcrb
**Agent ID:** cmfye7oj60006u3cwajeo7jg7

## Commands That Worked Successfully

### 1. Authentication
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"mcdowellj@decian.com","password":"Jakeandanna1!"}'
# ✅ SUCCESS: Returned valid JWT token
```

### 2. Agent Listing
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]"
# ✅ SUCCESS: Shows agent cmfye7oj60006u3cwajeo7jg7 ONLINE
```

### 3. Assessment Creation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/assessments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentId":"cmfye7oj60006u3cwajeo7jg7","modules":["MISCONFIGURATION_DISCOVERY","WEAK_PASSWORD_DETECTION"]}'
# ✅ SUCCESS: Created assessment cmfysmls00001u3p8d80ydd0h
```

### 4. Assessment Queueing
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/assessments/cmfysmls00001u3p8d80ydd0h/enqueue \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentIds":["cmfye7oj60006u3cwajeo7jg7"],"modules":["MISCONFIGURATION_DISCOVERY","WEAK_PASSWORD_DETECTION"]}'
# ✅ SUCCESS: Created job cmfysn2u70003u3p8eed6jcrb
```

### 5. Agent Execution
```bash
./workflow-test-agent.exe run --verbose
# ✅ SUCCESS: Agent processed job and completed assessment modules
```

### 6. Job Completion Verification
```bash
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db "SELECT id, status, created_at FROM jobs WHERE id = 'cmfysn2u70003u3p8eed6jcrb';"
# ✅ SUCCESS: Job status = SUCCEEDED
```

## What Didn't Work

### 7. Assessment Results Creation
```bash
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM assessment_results WHERE assessment_id = 'cmfysmls00001u3p8d80ydd0h';"
# ❌ FAILURE: Returns 0 (no assessment results created)
```

## Data Analysis

### Job Result Data Structure (CORRECT)
```json
{
  "assessmentId": "cmfysmls00001u3p8d80ydd0h",
  "completedAt": "2025-09-25T02:28:37Z",
  "overallRiskScore": 27.5,
  "resultCount": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "checkType": "MISCONFIGURATION_DISCOVERY",
      "data": {"findings": [{"category": "User Accounts", "findings": ["Anonymous access is not restricted"]}], "total_issues": 1},
      "riskLevel": "LOW",
      "riskScore": 15
    },
    {
      "checkType": "WEAK_PASSWORD_DETECTION",
      "data": {"findings": [{"category": "Password Policy", "findings": ["System does not crash on audit failure"]}], "total_issues": 4},
      "riskLevel": "MEDIUM",
      "riskScore": 40
    }
  ]
}
```

### Schema Expectations (MATCHES)
- `checkType`: MISCONFIGURATION_DISCOVERY, WEAK_PASSWORD_DETECTION ✅
- `riskLevel`: LOW, MEDIUM ✅
- `riskScore`: 15, 40 ✅
- `resultData`: JSON stringified data ✅

## Three Possible Root Causes

### 1. **Silent Prisma Transaction Failure**
The `maybeUpdateAssessment` function might be failing silently in a transaction context, causing the entire operation to roll back without explicit error logging.

### 2. **Missing Assessment ID Reference**
The `assessmentId` field in the job result data might not be properly mapping to an existing assessment record, causing a foreign key constraint violation during `createMany`.

### 3. **Type Coercion Issue in Prisma**
Despite the data appearing correct, Prisma might be experiencing type coercion issues between the JavaScript strings (`"LOW"`, `"MEDIUM"`) and the database enum values, particularly on Windows/SQLite.

## Next Steps
1. Add explicit logging around the Prisma transaction in `jobController.ts`
2. Verify assessment record exists before attempting result creation
3. Test with individual `create()` calls instead of `createMany()` to isolate the issue
