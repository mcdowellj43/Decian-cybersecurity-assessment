# Assessment Results Storage Issue - Fix Attempts Summary

## Problem
Assessment jobs execute successfully with the agent generating proper findings and risk scores, but results are not being stored in the `assessment_results` table. The `maybeUpdateAssessment` function in `jobController.ts` fails at the `prisma.assessmentResult.createMany()` operation.

**Symptoms:**
- Agent executes assessments successfully ✅
- Job results stored in `job_results` table ✅
- Assessment marked as `COMPLETED` ✅
- Assessment API shows `"results": []` ❌
- Backend logs: "Failed at createMany operation" ❌

## Root Cause Investigation
The `maybeUpdateAssessment` function successfully:
1. Retrieves job results from database ✅
2. Processes and maps the summary data ✅
3. Creates assessment results array ✅
4. **FAILS** at database write operation ❌

## Fix Attempts

### Fix #1: Date Format Issue ❌ FAILED
**Theory:** Prisma date format incompatibility
**Change:** Changed `createdAt: new Date()` to `new Date().toISOString()`
**Result:** Still failed at createMany operation
**Test:** Assessment `cmfyhfq2t0001u3pgvnleq8ic` - results remained empty

### Fix #2: Better Error Handling ❌ FAILED
**Theory:** Silent errors hiding root cause
**Change:** Added try-catch block with detailed logging around createMany
**Result:** Enhanced logging but same failure
**Test:** Assessment `cmfyhhser0001u3fs4how1j16` - results remained empty

### Fix #3: Schema Field Conflict ❌ FAILED
**Theory:** Conflicting `createdAt` field with `@default(now())`
**Change:** Removed explicit `createdAt` from mapping, let Prisma auto-generate
**Result:** Still failed at createMany operation
**Test:** Assessment `cmfyhkiuw0001u3b4rkc0miuo` - results remained empty

## Current Status
- **Problem**: Unresolved - database write operation consistently failing
- **Next Steps**: Need to examine actual job result data structure and potential enum/field mismatches
- **Impact**: Core functionality works, but dashboard cannot display assessment results

## Important Context
- All tests conducted on fresh database with proper schema
- Agent execution is 100% successful with correct findings
- Jobs API workflow is fully functional
- Issue is isolated to the results copying mechanism in `jobController.ts:293-312`
- Enhanced logging shows failure occurs specifically at `prisma.assessmentResult.createMany()` call
